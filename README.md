# Introduction
Just a simple WIP genetic algorithm-trained neural network.
Not a fancy TWEANN or NEAT, just a simple MLP. 
First time trying this. Never used C#/.NET before either.
Not even sure whether this project will even finish!

# Getting Started
Just load the project in the latest stable build of VS2017 - Didn't add 3rd party libraries or anything.

# Contribute
Um... Haven't thought about this yet.
